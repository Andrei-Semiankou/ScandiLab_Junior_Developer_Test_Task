# ScandiLab_Junior_Developer_Test_Task
# Setting up the project
1. Clone project: $ git clone https://github.com/Andrei-Semiankou/ScandiLab_Junior_Developer_Test_Task.git
2. $ npm i
3. $ npm run json-server
4. $ npm run server

Go to http://localhost:8080/ and have fun.

I understand that in this task you told me to use PHP and MySQL,
but I'm honestly telling you I have never used PHP, I didn't work with it, 
and I decided to use JSON server, that was my decision for this test task.

Sincerely

Andrey Semenkov
